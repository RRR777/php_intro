We can use a lot of  PHP type hinting in PHP 7.1+:
Scalar types for function parameters:
- int
- float
- bool
- string
- interfaces
- array
- callable
Return Type Declarations (? - nullable,type)
- array: function foo(): ?array
- bool: function foo(): ?bool
- callable: function foo(): ?callable
- float: function foo(): ?float
- int: function foo(): ?int
- iterable: function foo(): ?iterable
- object: function foo(): ?object
- self: function foo(): ?self
- string: function foo(): ?string
- class names: function foo(): ?ClassName

An incorrect data type would result in the following fatal error:
```$xslt
Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Argument 1 passed to test() must be an instance of MyClass, string given, called in 
/app/index.php on line 12 and defined in /app/index.php:8
```

When using Type hinting we can specify the expected data (arrays, objects, interface, etc.) for an argument in a 
function declaration. This practice can be most advantageous because it results in better code organization and 
improved error messages.

Calling only Book class object
function read(Book $book)
{
    echo "Reading the book called " . book->title;
    echo "<p>" . book->description . "</p>";
}

Pros:
- Type hinting isn't required, but it can allow us to catch certain types of mistakes.
- More correct and self-documenting PHP programs can be written. 
- Can make code easier to read.
- Gives us more control over our code.
- Specifying which type of variable is being set instead of allowing PHP to set this automatically. 
- Only a variable of exact type of the type declaration will be accepted, or a TypeError will be thrown.
- We donâ€™t need try to guess what variable has what type.
- Declaring return types Prevent sub-types from breaking the expected return type of the super-type1), especially in interfaces
- Declaring return types Prevent unintended return values

Cons:
- Each time you create a PHP file, you should put this strict type declaration on top:
```$xslt
declare(strict_types = 1);
```
- if types are not same we get: Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: 
- need to be very careful with nullable value.
- we need to set up the Scalar and return type;
